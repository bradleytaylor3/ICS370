Is history best characterized as an endless sequence of conflicts, or is it primarily a story of cooperation? What role does communication play in stoking or defusing conflict? Exploring themes such as power, justice, war, civil resistance, hatred, and peace, this course draws from historical and social science perspectives in order to critically examine the discourses and behaviors associated with violence and nonviolence. We delve into theories of violence and nonviolence, evaluate historical examples, and consider the forms that violence can take other than the physical. We will also study communication strategies that resolve rather than perpetuate or amplify conflict.
