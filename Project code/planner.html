        <p>All new or readmitted undergraduate students admitted fall 2016 or later must complete an approved learning
            experience (at least 3 credits) with a significant focus on race and racism to graduate with a bachelor's
            degree from the university.  Upon review, an approved prior learning, independent study, theory seminar or
            transfer course from other accredited institutions may also be used to meet this graduation requirement.</p>

        <h3><u>Goal 1: Communication</u></h3>
        <p>To develop writers and speakers who use the English language effectively and who read, write, speak and
            listen critically. As a base, all students should complete introductory communication requirements early
            in their collegiate studies. Writing competency is an ongoing process to be reinforced through
            writing-intensive courses and writing across the curriculum. Speaking and listening skills need
            reinforcement through multiple opportunities for interpersonal communication, public speaking,
            and discussion.</p>

        <h3><u>Goal 2: Critical Thinking</u></h3>
        <p>To develop thinkers who are able to unify factual, creative, rational, and value-sensitive modes of thought.
            Critical thinking will be taught and used throughout the general education curriculum in order to develop
            students' awareness of their own thinking and problem-solving procedures. To integrate new skills into
            their customary ways of thinking, students must be actively engaged in practicing thinking skills and
            applying them to open-ended problems.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="goal-3">
        <h3><u>Goal 3: Natural Sciences</u></h3>
        <p>To improve students' understanding of natural science principles and of the methods of scientific inquiry,
            i.e., the ways in which scientists investigate natural science phenomena. As a basis for lifelong learning,
            students need to know the vocabulary of science and to realize that while a set of principles has been
            developed through the work of previous scientists, ongoing scientific inquiry and new knowledge will bring
            changes in some of the ways scientists view the world. By studying the problems that engage today's
            scientists, students learn to appreciate the importance of science in their lives and to understand the
            value of a scientific perspective. Students should be encouraged to study both the biological and physical
            sciences.</p>
